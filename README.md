# EmerGo

EmerGo is an Android application that allows users to store and access their medical information in case of an emergency. The app encrypts and stores the information in a QR code, which can be easily retrieved by emergency responders or medical professionals by scanning the code, even without an internet connection or the need to download the app. After a period of inactivity (determined within the app), the QR code appears on top of the wallpaper.
